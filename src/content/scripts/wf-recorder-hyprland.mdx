The other day, my friend asked me to test an app he developed. I had just reset Arch a few days ago and didn't want to use Obs again, so I decided to use [wf-recorder](https://github.com/ammen99/wf-recorder). I wanted to use it properly and not record how I left the terminal after using wf-recorder ... or how I killed the process in the terminal to stop recording. So, I made a script and added a keybind to use it.

First, it checks if wf-recorder is running by trying to get its process ID and then finishes the script. If no instance of wf-recorder is running, it starts recording.

```bash
#!/bin/env bash

pgrep -x "wf-recorder" && pkill -INT -x wf-recorder && exit 0

dateTime=$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%H:%M:%S)
wf-recorder --bframes max_b_frames -f $HOME/Videos/$dateTime.mp4
```

Then I added a keybind to my Hyprland config file to execute the script using `Win + R`.

```conf
...
bind = $mainMod, R, exec, /script/path
```

It works! I think so...

Using the keybind, I don't know for sure if it is recording or if it stopped recording until I see the file saved. It is really annoying, so I added some notifications using notify-send to know when recording starts and stops.

```bash
#!/bin/env bash

pgrep -x "wf-recorder" && pkill -INT -x wf-recorder && notify-send -h string:wf-recorder:record -t 1000 "Finished Recording" && exit 0

notify-send -h string:wf-recorder:record -t 1000 "Recording in:" "<span color='#90a4f4' font='26px'><i><b>3</b></i></span>"

sleep 1

notify-send -h string:wf-recorder:record -t 1000 "Recording in:" "<span color='#90a4f4' font='26px'><i><b>2</b></i></span>"

sleep 1

notify-send -h string:wf-recorder:record -t 950 "Recording in:" "<span color='#90a4f4' font='26px'><i><b>1</b></i></span>"

sleep 1

dateTime=$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%H:%M:%S)
wf-recorder --bframes max_b_frames -f $HOME/Videos/$dateTime.mp4
```

If you have a better script or want to improve this you can reach me in social media.
